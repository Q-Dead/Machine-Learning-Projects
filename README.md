# Machine Learning Projects

Consist of mini-projects on machine-learning that I you for studying.

for example making a model from scratch


## Types of Machine Learning Systems

- Supervised Machine Learning

- Unsupervised Machine Learning

- Semi-supervised learning

- Reinforcement Learning

### Batch and Online Learning

- Batch Learning
- Online Learning

### Instance-Based and Model-Based Learning

- Instance-Based
- Model-Based


## Lessons Learned

What is machine learning?
    - It is a field of study wherein in we give the computer the ability to learn from data using learning algorithms. In other world computer can have hypothesis without giving it an explicit instruction

What is a supervised learning?
    - Supervised learning is when we already have a solution on our training and the solution is called labels

What is unsupervised learning?
    - In unsupervised learning the data that we feed on the learning algorithms dont have a solution or labels. So it up to the algorithms to look a relationship within the data

What is Reinforcement Learning
    - reinforcement learning is like there is no agreed upon a behavior. We give it a reward when we like the behavior and we give a penalties when we dont like the behavior

What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
